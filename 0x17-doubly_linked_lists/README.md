2-add_dnodeint.c is a function that adds a new mode at the beginning of a dlistint_t list.

3-add_dnodeint_end.c is a function that adds a new node at the end of a dlistint_t list.

4-free_dlistint.c is a function that frees a dlistint_t list.

5-get_dnodeint.c is a function that returns the nth node of a dlistint_t linked list.

6-sum_dlistint.c is a function that returns the sum of all the data (n) of a dlistint_t linked list.

7-insert_dnodeint.c is a function that inserts a new node at a given position.

8-delete_dnodeint.c is a function that deletes the node at index of a dlistint_t linked list.
