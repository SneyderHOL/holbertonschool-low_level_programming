Project containing severall programs using hash tables in C

Concepts:

    What is a hash function
    What makes a good hash function
    What is a hash table, how do they work and how to use them
    What is a collision and what are the main ways of dealing with collisions in the context of a hash table
    What are the advantages and drawbacks of using hash tables
    What are the most common use cases of hash tables


Describing each program:

0-hash_table_creat.c is a function that creates a hash table.

1-djb2.c is a function implementing the djb2 algorithm.

2-key_index.c is a function that gives you the index of a key.

3-hash_table_set.c is a function that adds an element to the hash table.

4-hash_table_get.c is a function that retrieves a value associated with a key.

5-hash_table_print.c is a function prints a hash table.

6-hash_table_delete.c is a function that deletes a hash table.

100-sorted_hash_table.c is function that uses the shash_node_s structure to make a sorted hash table.
