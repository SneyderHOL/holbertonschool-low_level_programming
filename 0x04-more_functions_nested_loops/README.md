# Project 0x04 C - More functions, more nested loops

Project using more functions, more nested loops in C

Concepts:

    What are nested loops and how to use them
    What is a function and how do you use functions
    What is the difference between a declaration and a definition of a function
    What is a prototype
    Scope of variables
    What are the gcc flags -Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra
    What are header files and how to to use them with #include

Decribing each program:

0-isupper.c is a function that will check for uppercase character.

1-isdigit.c is a function that will check for a digit (0 through 9).

2-mul.c is a function that will mulitiplies two integers.

3-print_numbers.c is a function that will print the numbers, from 0 to 9.

4-print_most_numbers.c is a function that will print the numbers from 0 to 9 except 2 and 4.

5-more_numbers.c is a function that will print 10 times the numbers, from 0 to 14.

6-print_line.c is a function that will draw a straight line in the terminal.

7-print_diagonal.c is a function that will draw a diagonal line on the terminal.

8-print_square.c is a function that will print a square.

9-fizz_buzz.c is a function that will print the numbers from 1 to 100, but for multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for multiples of five print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz.

10-print_triangle.c is a function that will print a triangle.

100-prime_factor.c is a function that will find and prints the largest prime factor of the number 612852475143.

101-print_number.c is a function that will print an integer.
