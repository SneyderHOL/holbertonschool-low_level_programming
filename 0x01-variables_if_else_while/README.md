Describing each program:

0-positive_or_negative.c is a program that will assing a random number to the variable n each time it is executed and printing 
    if the number is greater than 0: is positive
    if the number is 0: is zero
    if the number is less than 0: is negative

1-last_digit.c is a program that will assing a random number to the variable n and each time it is executed and printing the last digit of the number
    if the last digit of n is greater than 5: the string and is greater than 5
    if the last digit of n is 0: the string and is 0
    if the last digit of n is less than 6 and not 0: the string and is less than 6 and not 0

2-print_alphabet.c is a program that will print the alphabet in lowercase.

3-print_alphabets.c is a program that will print the alphabet in lowercase and then in uppercase.

4-print_alphabt.c is a program that will print the alphabet in lowercase, except for q and e.

5-print_numbers.c is a program that will print all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0.

6-print_numberz.c is a program that will print all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, whitout using a variable of type char.

7-print_tebahpla.c is a program that will print the lowercase alphabet in reverse.

8-print_base16.c is a program that will print all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase.

9-print_comb.c is a program that will print all posible combinations of single-digit numbers, separated by ,.

10-print_comb2.c is a program that will print the numbers from 00 to 99, separated by ,.

100-print_comb3.c is a program that will print all possible different combinations of two digits, separated by ,.

101-print_comb3.c is a program that will print all possible different combinations of three digits, separated by ,.

102-print_comb4.c is a program that will print all possible combinations of two two-digits numbers, separated by ,.
