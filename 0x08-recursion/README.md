# Project 0x08 - Recursion

Programs in C, all using recursion

Concepts:

    What is recursion
    How to implement recursion
    In what situations you should implement recursion
    In what situations you shouldnâ€™t implement recursion

Describing each program:

0-puts_recursion.c is a function that will print a string.

1-print_rev_recursion.c is a function that will print a string in reverse.

2-strlen_recursion.c is a function that will return the length of a string.

3-factorial.c is a function that will return the factorial of a given number.

4-pow_recursion.c is a function that will return the value of x raised to the power of y.

5-sqrt_recursion.c is a function that will return the natural square root of a number.

6-is_prime_number.c is a function that will return 1 if the input integer is a prime number, otherwise return 0.

7-is_palindrome.c is a function that will return 1 if a string is a palindrome and 0 if not.

100-wildcmp.c is a function that will compare two strings and returns 1 if the string can be considered identical, otherwise return 0.
