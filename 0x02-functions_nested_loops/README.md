# Project 0x02 C - Functions, nested loops

Using nested loops and functions in C

Concepts:

    What are nested loops and how to use them
    What is a function and how do you use functions
    What is the difference between a declaration and a definition of a function
    What is a prototype
    Scope of variables
    What are the gcc flags -Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra
    What are header files and how to to use them with #include

2-print_alphabet_x10.c is a function that will print 10 times the alphabet in lowercase.

3-islower.c is a function that will check for lowercase character.

4-isalpha.c is a function that will check for alphabet character.

5-sign.c is a function that will print the sign of a number.

6-abs.c is a function that will computes the absolute value of an integer.

7-print_last_digit.c is a function that will print the last digit of a number.
